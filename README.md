2 – In terminal <b>(python kernel)</b> type command:  <b>python bills_app.py</b>/b><br></br>
3 – Click on the link that appears in the terminal, e.g. <b>http://127.0.01:5000/</b></b>

## Method
### Applications

The project utilised a wide range of platforms, libraries, languages and databases, including;

* Python/Flask API
* MongoDB
* HTML/CSS
* Javascript
  * D3.js
  * Leaflet
  * Dimple

#### Python/Flask API

A <b>Python/Flask-powered API</b> was used to push data onto the database. Python was also used to perform ETL tasks to manipulate and clean datasets (via Jupyter Notebook).

#### MongoDB

<b>MongoDB</b> was utilised to capture real-time information of the world’s richest billionaire (including image, name and net-worth). This information was used as an interactive dashboard that is searchable and allows the user to filter and sort billionaire information.

#### HMTL/CSS

<b>HTML/CSS</b> was utlised to design and build an interactive dashboard that will allow users to choose billionaire profiles from a range of drop-down menus and text boxes, revealing summary information of each billionaire.

#### Javascript/D3.js

Multiple <b>JavaScript</b> libraries were used to plot the data in an interactive way. 

#### Leaflet (*requires user API key)

<b>Leaflet</b> was used to plot Billiionaire information on a global map. When hovered, front-end information is revealed, showing billionaire names and their respective net-worth based on their geographical location. 

#### Dimple

<b>Dimple</b> was also selected as an additional Javascript library to provide an interactive visualisation and aspect to the project. When hovered, the chart shows the number of billionaires per country simulataneously.
